            <h2>Chapter 1 - the escape</h2>
            <p>My breathing was shaky, I narrowly managed to leap from the castle walls, I escaped with my life, but I can’t say the same for the rest of my people. A large group of Orks swept through my kingdom, killing anyone in their way. I was powerless to stop them, as regular weaponry did nothing against their thick skin.</p>
            <p>I have heard tales of a magically enchanted sword forged by Andúril, which is the only weapon that can pierce their skin. Last I heard, the sword was in possession by the elves. I'll try to reach their kingdom in hopes of getting their help, though it might be futile.</p>
            <p>Regardless, every step I take is a step towards victory, towards justice...</p>
            <p>Towards my kingdoms and peoples revival</p>
            <p>As you run away from the castle walls you hear the war cries of the orcs. <span class="italic">Shit, I have to move fast</span></p>
